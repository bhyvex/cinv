Sexy - the make-the-sysadmin-happy-tool
========================================


Preamble
--------
To be able to use the sexy suite, you have to agree to the following
principle:


- Do not care how something is done (realised with 'backends').
- One aim is to minimise the time spend doing a job (realised with 'frontends').

If you care about how things are done, sexy is suitable for you.


Utilisation (= What I want to do)
---------------------------------

I want to add a new host ($name $mac $network $location $remarks)
and after some time everything is working.

What is everything?
-------------------
- Add host to my inventory
- Add host to DHCP (I don't care which address it has)
- Add host to DNS
