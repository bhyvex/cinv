Sexy - the sysadmin swiss army knife
====================================
sexy - the sysadmin swiss army knife

You define a state - sexy takes care of what needs to be done.

Preamble
--------
Sexy assumes that you've processes that you would like to automate.
Sexy gives you a framework to drop your processes into and makes
you forget about HOW something is solved.

The basic idea is that you draw some sketch on your whiteboard,
beginning with "what I want to do" (for instance: create virtual machines).
Now draw a graph containing all dependencies needed for the process,
like this:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I want a virtual machine with 512M RAM (other stuff I don't care).
|- requires: virtual machine host with >= 512M RAM
  |- requires: virtual machine hypervisor
   |- requires: operating system
    |- requires: real machine (hardware)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you're done, you create a sexy-plugin for each dependency and
the task you would like to solve, like this:

- vm
- vm-host
- os
- hardware

Now your plugin "vm" can contain methods like "create", "delete" etc.
which use the vm-host plugin to check whether a suitable
vm-host is available and if not, it can check whether there's an os
available for a vm-host and if not it can check for relevant hardware.
IF no suitable hardware is found, it can call the method "aquire"
of the hardware plugin, to generate a mail to buy and install hardware,
etc.

The key to get this working is to find out about the dependencies and
automate each step in a sexy-plugin.

And yes, the authors of sexy use this approach to manage their
real world clusters.
