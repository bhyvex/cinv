Sexy - the make-the-sysadmin-happy-tool
========================================


Preamble
--------
To be able to use the sexy suite, you have to agree to the following
principle:


- Do not care how something is done (realised with 'backends').
- One aim is to minimise the time spend doing a job (realised with 'frontends').

If you care about how things are done, sexy is suitable for you.


Utilisation (= What I want to do)
---------------------------------
I want to add a new host ($name $mac $network $location $remarks)
and after some time everything is working. I do not want to spend
any time on waiting, but want to be notified, when everything is
working or if after a time out stuff is *not* working.


What is everything?
-------------------
- Add host to my inventory
- Add host to DHCP (I don't care which address it has)
- Add host to DNS


Where and how to store the information?
---------------------------------------
$db/hosts/<name>/
   inventory-id         # 2150-XXXXXX
   mac                  # 00:de:ad:ba:be:00
   ipv4a                # 192.168.42.42
   aliases              # fqdn, fdqn, ... (\n seperated)
   tags                 # foo, bar, ..., can also be tag=value, "location=cab" (\n seperated)

$db/networks/<ipa>/
   description          # freeform, one line
   mask                 # Bits: like 16, 25, ...
   vlan                 # ????????

$db/tags/<name>/
   description

$db/config/backends/<type>/
   get                  # symlink to get dir of selected backend implementation
   set                  # symlink to set dir of selected backend implementation


            dns            eth-id-ws
            dns            generic-unix-nametools(with dig and co)
libexec/<backend-type>/<backend-implementation>/
   get/
      get-subtype       # get-a-entry, get-cname, get....
   set/
      set-subtype       # get-a-entry, get-cname, get....
   
libexec/<backend-type>/<backend-implementation>/

What needs to be implemented for backend X
------------------------------------------

Backend dns
~~~~~~~~~~~

dns/../get/a ->

get
^^^
   a:
      input:
         argv1 = $hostname
      output:
         stdout = ip or empty (not existing)
         return code: ip = 0, not existing = 1

   cname-existing???????

set
^^^^
   a:
      input:
         argv1 = $hostname
         argv2 = $ip
      output:
         ok: 
            return code: 0
         error:
            return code: 1
            stderr: <message>


Naming / wording
-----------------
Host = ressource
Host has attributes



How to realise the stored configuration?
-----------------------------------------
Via backends, which are independent of the frontend.

General
~~~~~~~
The frontend defines the target state, while the backend
analyses the target state, compares it to the
present situation and applies the needed changes to get
to the target state.


Backend triggering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- frontend generated data -> backend-process transfer
- backend triggered by
   - change: check after changes occured
      - data collector: retrieve present situation for changed ressources
   - time: check that configuration is still valid
      - data collector: retrieve present situation for all ressources (contiously)

Backend realisation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
$backend <if ressources-> only ressources>
   no args = all ressources (-> cron)


DHCP
~~~~

Communication
-------------

Via Unix standard methods:

- command line parameters ($@, ARGV, **argv, as you like)
- stdin/stdout
- environment variables

Programming language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Independent of the used language. Use the right tool for the right job!



Detailled description of hosts management
-----------------------------------------

sexy host add $name $tag1
   -> needs at least one tag.?????????


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
sexy host add $name $mac $ipv4a        AR=Nico

results in
   host/$name/
      mac=$mac
      ipv4a=$ipv4a
[frontend done]

sexy sync-to-backends(?)
   transfers data to backend
   most likely == git push

Backend part:

   ???sexy-backend-FOO???: 

   gets changes: for ressource=$name, attributes=mac,ipv4a
   get current state for ressource=$name, attributes=mac,ipv4a

   apply needed changes for dns-entry and dhcp-entry

dns-entry: host<->ipv4a
   exists a-entry host?
      yes: is it $ipv4a?
         yes: done
         no:
            change to $ipv4
      no:
         add a-entry with value $ipv4

dhcp-entry: host: mac<->ipv4a
   exists dhcp-entry for $host?
      yes: are mac and ipv4 correct?
         yes: done
         no:
            change what needed
      no:
         add dhcp-entry with values $ipv4, $mac

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Concrete realisation plan (!!!!!!!!!!)
--------------------------------------
- Nico: sexy frontend for host add with name, mac, ipv4a
- Steven: Define DNS-Backend specification (methods and ways for dns-backends: args, communication?)
- Steven: utilise webservice for dns via command line (= dns/eth-id-ws implementation)
- Create "generic-backend" that accepts changes and calls specific implementations (=backend-runner, give-me-a-name)
- :Get current dns state (unix-generic)


Host add
~~~~~~~~

- hostname
- type
- location
- mac-address (optional)
- remarks


Managing networks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add network?

Add host to network

Other tools I need
------------------
- host remove
- host rename
- host alias add
- host change mac addr
- host change ip addr


Database ideas
--------------
Trusted DB without modifications from unstrusted people!


DHCP
----

host {
   # var=value
   # var=value
   # var=value
   # var=value
}

--> untrusted  source!


cconfig
-------
- Easy to use!
- Easily version controlled




Random thoughts
---------------
- host alias add: create new inventory item, linked to the original one?
