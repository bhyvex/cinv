Sexy - the make-the-sysadmin-happy-tool
========================================


Preamble
--------
To be able to use the sexy suite, you have to agree to the following
principle:


- Do not care how something is done (realised with 'backends').
- One aim is to minimise the time spend doing a job (realised with 'frontends').

If you care about how things are done, sexy is suitable for you.


Utilisation (= What I want to do)
---------------------------------
I want to add a new host ($name $mac $network $location $remarks)
and after some time everything is working. I do not want to spend
any time on waiting, but want to be notified, when everything is
working or if after a time out stuff is *not* working.

What is everything?
-------------------
- Add host to my inventory
- Add host to DHCP (I don't care which address it has)
- Add host to DNS


Where and how to store the information?
---------------------------------------
$db/hosts/<name>/
   inventory-id         # 2150-XXXXXX
   mac                  # 00:de:ad:ba:be:00
   ipa                  # 192.168.42.42
   location             # freeform, one line
   tags                 # foo, bar, ... (\n seperated)
   type                 # freeform, one line

networks/<ipa>/
   description
   mask
   vlan

# Optional
tags/<name>/
   description


Other tools I need
------------------
- host remove
- host rename
- host alias add
- host change mac addr
- host change ip addr

Random thoughts
---------------
- host alias add: create new inventory item, linked to the original one?
