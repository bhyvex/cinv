GENERATE DHCP FOR ALL NETWORKS/HOSTS!

- list networks
   - create "array"
- list hosts
   - retrieve ip address

Iterate over objects (?)
Iterate over networks !
   Init network
   Find hosts that belong to network
   Add host to network
   Close network

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To find out whether a host is in a specfic network, one needs either to
   - iterate over all networks
   - or save the information somewhere

As this task will happen everytime when checking the state, it's preferred not
to search for it every time. As a host can in theory exist in several networks,
have multiple ipv4a entries, ...
   That's complex. Complex things are not sexy. Thus this is not supported.
   Configure other interfaces with different tools like puppet or create a
   second entry in a different network.
   That's not sexy, but complex. We don't do that.
